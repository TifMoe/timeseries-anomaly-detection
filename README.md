## Learning about Timeseries Anomaly Detection

### Data
We want to use an open source dataset with sensor data to start learning about different preprocessing and modeling techniquesbut these are hard to come by for infrastructure! Luckily, there is a [Kaggle dataset for pump sensor data](https://www.kaggle.com/nphantawee/pump-sensor-data) which we can use to get started.

### Preprocessing Options
These are some preprocessing techniques we may want to consider

#### Dimentionality Reduction
Depending on the number of input features, we may want to condense them into a more concise signal to reduce the dimensionality of our problem space. Some techniques may include:

- **Principle Component Analysis (PCA)**

    - [A One-Stop Shop for Principal Component Analysis](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-one-stop-shop-for-principal-component-analysis-5582fb7e0a9c)
